# Jeff Window Example

This repository contains a simple Tkinter script that opens a white window named Jeff. The window now shows the live BTC price and opens an additional window with a 15-minute candlestick chart. It still includes a text output field for displaying messages.

## Usage

Install the required dependencies and run the script with Python 3:

```bash
pip install matplotlib mplfinance pandas requests
python white_surface.py
```
